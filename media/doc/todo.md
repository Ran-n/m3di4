# TODO
- [ ] Make Groups and Issues able to have a related Poster too.
- [ ] Entertain the idea of making a global type and/or status table instead of one for each typed element.
- [ ] Make queries (like get\_all) to discriminate against dormant (non active) entries.
- [ ] Fix terminal view so that it doesnt assume that adding a single file means its a media, it can be an issue.
- [ ] Make the CustomTKinter GUI.
- [ ] Allow inserting dates before year 0.
- [ ] Check if a date of an issue is in between the appropiate years according to its group/media
- [ ] Dont only show name on "Group"s since it can be null and number is more important anyways.
- [ ] Make less confusing what part of input you are in when a subinput is opened (insert group of newly created media)
- [ ] Add authors of medias or issues and of files (this is tricky because it would also imply, if done correctly, to add attributions).

## Tasks
- [ ] Make Issue not always have Group.
- [ ] Implement the adding of descriptions to added elements.
