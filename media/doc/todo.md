# TODO
- [ ] Automatically add all information about a File.
    - [X] Make Add Function for WarehouseType
    - [X] Make Add Function for Warehouse
    - [ ] Make "info.py" a service.
- [ ] Make the CustomTKinter GUI.
- [ ] Allow inserting dates before year 0.
- [ ] Check if a date of an issue is in between the appropiate years according to its group/media
- [ ] Dont only show name on "MediaGroup"s since it can be null and number is more important anyways.
- [ ] Make less confusing what part of input you are in when a subinput is opened (insert media group of newly created media)
- [ ] Add authors (this is tricky because it would also imply, if done correctly, to add attributions).

## Tasks
- [ ] Make MediaIssue not always have MediaGroup.
- [ ] Implement the adding of descriptions to added elements.
