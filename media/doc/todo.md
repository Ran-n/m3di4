    - [ ] Make service to connect to the API of Telegram.
    - [ ] Use the service for updating the subs of ShareSite depending on Platform (use thread).
- [ ] Dont only show name on "MediaGroup"s since it can be null and number is more important anyways.
- [ ] Make less confusing what part of input you are in when a subinput is opened (insert media group of newly created media)
